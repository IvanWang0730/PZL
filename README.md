# Controlling Style in Neural Machine Translation via Prompt-based Zero-shot Learning
Code and Data for Paper [Controlling Style in Neural Machine Translation via Prompt-based Zero-shot Learning](https://translate.volcengine.com/), this paper proposes 1) a dataset **m**ultiway **s**tylized **m**achine **t**ranslation (**MSMT**) benchmark, including four language directions with diverse language styles. 2) a **p**rompt-based **z**ero-shot **l**earning (**PZL**) method to avoid re-tuning time after time. Through automatic evaluation and human evaluation, our method achieves a re- markable improvement over baselines and other methods. A series of analysis also show the advantages of our method.
